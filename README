Admin-Clipper
=============
admin-clipper removes all boundary parts that are in or close to a water geometry (or any other clipping geometry).
The clipped boundaries are extended back to the coastline.
During the process, polygon boundaries are converted linestring boundaries.

Dependencies
============

    pip install fiona pyproj shapely


Example
=======

    python admin_clipper.py \
        --clip-file=water.shp \
        --src-file=admin.geojson \
        --result-file=clipped.geojson \
        --clip-srs='EPSG:3857' \
        --src-srs='EPSG:25832' \
        --clip-buffer=100 \
        --min-segment-length=2000
